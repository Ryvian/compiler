1. "else" statement:
    the statements before "else" and after "else" have to be braced with "begin"
    and "end". Example:
        if i = 2 then
            begin
                i := 3;
                i := 5;
            end
        else
            begin
                i := 4;
            end


2. continous assignment
    i := j := k := mA
     "m" has to be a number or a constant
